Using [Pastebin](http://pastebin.com) as a Cloud
================================================

# Pastebin

Quoted from their FAQs:

> Pastebin.com is a website where you can store text for a certain period of
> time. The website is mainly used by programmers to store pieces of sources
> code or configuration information, but anyone is more than welcome to paste
> any type of text. The idea behind the site is to make it more convenient for
> people to share large amounts of text online.

Here we have the main keyword which led me to the idea, more than once, to use
it as a cloud storage.

It is the keyword **_store_**.

## FAQs

> You've just quoted their FAQs.

Yes I did.

Here is the link: [FAQs](http://pastebin.com/faq).

## Why Pastebin?

There is no particular reason for (at least not while I am writing this) using
Pastebin. You could also use [GitHub's Gists](https://gist.github.com) or some
similar service.

## Has someone done that before?

Honestly, I do not know.

## Is it allowed?

Quoted from their FAQs again:

> Please do NOT post:
> - email lists
> - login details
> - stolen source code
> - password lists
> - personal information / data
> - pornographic information / data
> - spam links (this includes promoting your own site)

So, from what I see, it could be allowed, as long as your personal information
is not personal, which could be solved using encryption.

**Please correct me at this point if I am wrong!**

# Problems

So, you want to implement it?

Okay, first we try to find out if it is possible.

## Limitations

Of course they have some limitations. They are not stupid.
