Using [Pastebin](http://pastebin.com) as a Cloud
================================================

# Pastebin

Quoted from their FAQs:

> Pastebin.com is a website where you can store text for a certain period of
> time. The website is mainly used by programmers to store pieces of sources
> code or configuration information, but anyone is more than welcome to paste
> any type of text. The idea behind the site is to make it more convenient for
> people to share large amounts of text online.

Here we have the main keyword which led me to the idea, more than once, to use
it as a cloud storage.

It is the keyword **_store_**.

## Why Pastebin?

There is no particular reason for (at least not while I am writing this) using
Pastebin. You could also use [GitHub's Gists](https://gist.github.com) or some
similar service.

## Has someone done that before?

Honestly, I do not know.
